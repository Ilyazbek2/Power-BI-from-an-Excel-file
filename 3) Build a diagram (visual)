(Example: create a Column chart showing Sales by Region.)

On the Visualizations pane click the Clustered column chart icon. A blank visual appears on the canvas.

Drag Region from Fields to Axis.

Drag Sales to Values (Power BI will aggregate; by default SUM for numeric).

(Optional) Drag Year to Legend to color by year or Product to Tooltip.

Format: click the visual → Format (paint roller) → set Title, Data labels, Axis options, and font sizes.

Resize & position the visual on the canvas. Add slicers (visual filter): choose Slicer visual and put Region or Year into it.
